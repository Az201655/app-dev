# THE BOYS 

The Boys series explores the world of Super Heroes, but the super heroes also have human flaws; lust, greed, sins, etc.
The Supes, the terminology used to say they are super human, have the fame of the "good", but commits evil too (e.g. A-Train
a supe that uses Compound V, a sort of drug that increases the effectivity of their powers, on a daily basis). The Supes are
not related to the military power of the government, they are within an organization called Vought. Vought monetizes supes for
money and fame, the Supes are nothing but a corrupt politician who wears a mask while outside their home base. In summary, The
Boys tells a story about corrupt supes.
